## Current Status:

✅ Sound files are available and working
✅ Sound service is configured and functional
✅ All sound effects are enabled in the app

## Platform Notes:

### Web Platform:
- Sounds require user interaction to start (browser security policy)
- First click/tap will enable audio for the session
- Some browsers may block autoplay audio

### Mobile Platforms:
- Sounds work immediately without user interaction
- Vibration feedback is also available on supported devices

## Note:

The app works perfectly with or without sound files. The sound service gracefully handles any audio issues and won't cause crashes or errors.
